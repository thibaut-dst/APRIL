**Analysis of Coastal Risk Perception in Occitanie** (A.P.Ri.L: Analyse de la Perception des Risques Littoraux en Occitanie)

The APRIL project analyzes how the population of the Occitanie region of southern France perceive coastal risks such as sea-level rise, erosion, and extreme weather events. By collecting and analyzing diverse web-based data (news articles, reports, social media, etc.), the project aims to inform adaptive coastal management policies through insights gained from Natural Language Processing (NLP).
